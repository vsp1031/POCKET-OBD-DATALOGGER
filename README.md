# Pocket OBD Datalogger

## Abstract
The Pocket OBD Datalogger is a compact and affordable solution for measuring battery State of Charge (SOC), Battery Health, and Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) in vehicles. It aims to enhance car inspections, particularly in the Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) department, by replacing traditional Multi-Function Tester (MFT) devices.

## Introduction
The Pocket OBD Datalogger addresses a critical need in the automotive industry, providing a compact and affordable solution for measuring battery State of Charge (SOC), Battery Health, and VIN of vehicles. This project aims to enhance car inspections, making them more efficient and cost-effective.

## Literature Survey
The OBD Data Logger plays a critical role in collecting and analyzing vehicle network data to assess performance and diagnose issues. The evolution of the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) System has led to improved monitoring of engine performance and emissions.

### Problem Statement
The current PDI process lacks an efficient method for assessing battery health and SOC, leading to post-sale issues like low battery voltage. Traditional MFT devices are expensive and time-consuming.

### Existing Solution
In the PDI area, checking electrical parameters is crucial to reduce issues after the sale of a car. The only method available was the costly and time-consuming MFT device.

### Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a cost-efficient Pocket OBD Datalogger that measures SOC and Battery Health in the PDI department. This tool, comprising an Arduino Uno, Can Bus Shield, LCD display, and micro SD card, ensures rapid data acquisition within 5 seconds.

## Description of Tasks
The project is divided into three main categories to reduce electrical issues after dispatch and costs.

### Subtasks
- **Mechanical**
- **Electronics**
- **Electrical and Control Technology**
- **Coding**

### Mechanical
- Design a robust mechanical framework using acrylic.
